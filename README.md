Choosing the right cabinet material is essential for durability, aesthetics, and functionality. Each material has its own benefits and drawbacks, so understanding your options can help you make an informed decision.

Not as strong as plywood
Susceptible to water damage if not sealed properly

4. Particle Board – Budget-Friendly Alternative
